<h1>Pwnagotchi and Me: A Raspberry Pi Experiment</h1>

<p>A Pwnagotchi is an open-source, AI-powered, portable Wi-Fi auditing tool designed to look and behave like a 1990s Tamagotchi-style virtual pet. Instead of food, it “feeds” on Wi-Fi handshake data collected from its surroundings.
        
It is primarily used by security researchers and enthusiasts for educational purposes, helping them learn about Wi-Fi vulnerabilities such as WPA handshakes, key cracking, and network auditing techniques. The Pwnagotchi monitors the nearby wireless environment and, when configured to do so, actively encourages the capture of WPA* handshake packets.

To make the experience more engaging, the device features an e-ink display showing a simple face whose expressions change based on activity—appearing happy when it successfully captures handshakes and bored when there’s nothing interesting happening. This playful design turns a serious security tool into something that feels oddly alive.
